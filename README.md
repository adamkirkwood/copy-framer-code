# Copy Framer Code plugin for Sketch

A Sketch plugin that copies selected layers to the clipboard as code that can be pasted straight into a Framer prototype.

- Copy one or more layers, or an entire artboard
- Layers are copied in position 
- Layers and TextLayers are drawn entirely in code*
- Export @ 1x, @ 2x or @ 3x

*If a layer is too complex to draw using code alone you will need to export and add a background image manually.

## New in Version 2
- **Support for Nested Layers**: Copy Framer Code now exports all nested layers inside any selected groups, adding the `parent` property to the sublayers.
- **Export artboards**: Select an artboard to copy all of its contents. 
- **Flatten groups** to a single layer by adding `*` to the end of the layerâ€™s name.
- **Hidden layers** are no longer imported.

## Install
Download or clone the repository, and double click `CopyFramerCode.sketchplugin`.
