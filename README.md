# Copy Framer Code plugin for Sketch

A Sketch plugin that copies any selected layer to the clipboard as code that can be pasted straight into a Framer prototype.

- Creates new Layers and TextLayers
- Layers are copied in position 
- Layers are drawn entirely in code 

If a layer is too complex to draw using code alone you will need to export and add a background image manually.

## Install
Download or clone the repository, and double click `CopyFramerCode.sketchplugin`.

## Usage
1. Select the layers in Sketch you want to copy
2. Select `Copy Framer Code > Copy Framer Code` from the Plugins menu
3. Paste the CoffeeScript into Framer.
