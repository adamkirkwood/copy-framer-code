# Copy Framer Code plugin for Sketch

A Sketch plugin that copies any selected layer to the clipboard as code that can be pasted straight into a Framer prototype.

- Creates new Layers and TextLayers
- Layers are copied in position 
- Layers are drawn entirely in code 

If a layer is too complex to draw using code alone you will need to export and add a background image manually.
